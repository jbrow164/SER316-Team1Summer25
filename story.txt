Ralph was having dinner with Trisha until he was distracted by the hund across the street. 
The hund was ravishing a Bratwurst with great German feircity, as this city was known for.
Trisha managed to regain Ralph's attention confused as to what he was talking about as they were at a Ratskeller.
"Sorry,” Ralph said, wiping his mouth, “but if that dog eats one more like that, he’s getting a one-way ticket out from Flughafen.”
Trisha sighed, muttering something about getting dessert, and wandered toward a nearby Bäckerei filled with the smell of fresh Gebäck.
Trisha was confused as to why she could not hold Ralph's attention. She had worn her best Dirndl, and yet now found herself feeling Wettbewerbsfaehig towards the dog. 
"Honestly," Ralph muttered, glancing back at the window, "that Hund eats like he's never seen Brot in his life."
Just then, a man in full Lederhose strolled by shouting about a missing Apfelkuchen, drawing gasps from nearby tables.
Ralph shrugged and ordered a waiter, asking if the Schloss special was still on the menu tonight.
However, Trisha was tired of hearing all the shouting and was trying to convince Ralph to go back in their BMW and head to a restaurant that had klimaanlage.

The mayor held a rock concert in front of Schloss Eltz featuring Rammstein, and handed out Gebaeck to everyone.
